Bull Bitcoin Mobile Wallet Terms and Conditions
These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Bull Bitcoin Mobile Wallet application (the "App"), created and distributed by Satoshi Portal Inc., a Canadian company (the "App Developers"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
The App is provided as free and open-source software. There is no contractual relationship between users of the Bull Bitcoin Wallet and the App Developers.
1. Wallet Services
1.1 The Bull Bitcoin Wallet is a self-custodial wallet for the Bitcoin Network and Liquid Network. The App Developers are never in control of user funds and are not involved in money transmission.
1.2 The responsibility to safeguard BTC and L-BTC private keys falls exclusively on the end-user. The App Developers cannot recover lost funds.
1.3 The App Developers cannot monitor, freeze, or seize any BTC and L-BTC assets held by users of the App.
1.4 Swap transactions between BTC and L-BTC, between BTC and Lightning, and between L-BTC and Lightning are provided by non-custodial third-party atomic swap services. These services are offered within the App via third-party API integrations, and the App Developers are not responsible for swap fees or swap failures.
1.5 Encrypted backup services are provided by non-custodial third-party backup service providers. These services are offered within the App via third-party API integrations, and the App Developers are not responsible for backup availability.
2. Exchange Services
2.1 The App provides an optional API client that allows users to link their Bull Bitcoin exchange account to the App by importing and storing an API key from an external exchange account managed outside of the App.
2.2 Bull Bitcoin exchange services are provided:

In Canada by Satoshi Portal Inc., registered as a Money Service Business;
In France by Leonod SARL, licensed as a Virtual Asset Service Provider; and
In Mexico by Toro Pagos S.A., registered as offering Operations with Virtual Assets.

2.3 Exchange services are only offered in countries or regions where the App has appropriate licensing and permissions to provide a cryptocurrency exchange.
2.4 Enforcement of Restrictions:

Exchange services are not available by default in the App. Access requires a Bull Bitcoin API key linked to an external Bull Bitcoin account.
When creating an external Bull Bitcoin account, users undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) process, providing personal information and documentation to verify identity. This includes, but is not limited to, IP address validation, phone number validation, government-issued identity document verification, selfie verification, proof of residence verification, and source of funds verification.
VPNs are detected using Maxmind, an IP analytics service. Phone numbers are verified using Telesign, a phone number analytics service. Identity, country of residence, and country of citizenship are verified using Incode, an identity verification service.
Through this process, Bull Bitcoin determines the user's country of residence and citizenship and restricts accounts in countries where exchange services cannot be legally offered.
Users in prohibited jurisdictions will be unable to access exchange features and will receive an error message indicating they are in a prohibited jurisdiction.

3. Privacy Policy
